# OOP - Closed laboratories
In this repo, I place solutions to the tasks which I did during my informatics object-oriented programming laboratories classes at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.
All code naming is made in Polish, we were required to do so.

## Laboratory 1
### C++ - Basics
During the first laboratory, we had to create a set of geometric figures based on figure class. These labs show the mechanisms of 4 OOP paradigms - abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
The project was written using Visual Studio 2022 and can be opened by opening the .sln file.

## Laboratory 2
### C++ - Advanced
This laboratory was focused not on universal OOP but more on C++ mechanics using the structure of Library - Shelf - Book, where every one of these is a part o the previous one. We checked the knowledge of usage of l- and r-references (and r-/l-values), inheritance and overloading iostream operators.
The project was also written using Visual Studio 2022 and can be opened by opening the .sln file.

## Laboratory 3
### Java - Basics
This laboratory thought me the basics of Java language syntax and usage. Also, it used inheritance, overloading built-in Java methods in java.lang.Object, implementing interfaces, creating and catching own Exceptions. In code, we have an example of geometric objects and transformations.
The project was written using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Laboratory 4
### Java - Advanced
In this laboratory, we created a short simulation of mountain hiking trips. There are a lot of classes, Java and OOP concepts use here (e.g. lambda functions, StreamAPI etc).
The project was written using IntelliJ IDEA.
