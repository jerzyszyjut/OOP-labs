# OOP - Closed laboratories
In this repo I place solutions to the tasks which I did during my informatics object-oriented programming laboratories classes at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.
All code naming is made in polish, we were required to do so.

## Laboratory 1
### C++ - Basics
During first laboratory we had to create a set of geometric figures basing on figure class. These labs show the mechanisms of 4 OOP paradigms - abstraction, inheritance, polimorphism and encapsulation.
Project was written using Visual Studio 2022 and can be opened by opening .sln file.

## Laboratory 2
### C++ - Advanced
This laboratory was focused not on universal OOP but more on C++ mechanics using the structure of Library - Shelf - Book, where every one of these is a part o previous one. We checked the knowledge of usage of l- and r-references (and r-/l-values), inheritance and overloading iostream operators.
Project was also written using Visual Studio 2022 and can be opened by opening .sln file.

## Laboratory 3
### Java - Basics
This laboratory thought me the basics of Java language syntax and usage. Also it used inheritance, overloading builtin Java methods in java.lang.Object, implementing interfaces, creating and catching own Exceptions. In code we have an example on geometric objects and transformations.
Project was written using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Laboratory 4
### Java - Advanced
In this laboratory we created an short simulation of mountain hiking trips. There are a lot of classes, Java and OOP concepts use here (e.g. lambda functions, StreamAPI etc).
Project was written using IntelliJ IDEA.
